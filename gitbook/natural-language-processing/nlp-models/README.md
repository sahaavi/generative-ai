# NLP Models

#### Neural Network Models in NLP

1. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**
   * Narrow neural networks
   * Self-learning capability
   * Foundation for more comprehensive networks
2. **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)**
   * Multiple hidden layers between input and output
   * Improved learning capability but lack memory
3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
   * Introduce memory to neural networks
   * Suffer from short-term memory
4. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
   * Improve RNNs by generating long-term memory
5. **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**
   * Popular variant of LSTM
   * Improved computational efficiency
