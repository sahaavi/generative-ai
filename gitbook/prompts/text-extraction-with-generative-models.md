# Text Extraction with Generative Models

### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Text extraction is a process of extracting text from a document. This can be done manually or automatically. Manual text extraction is the process of reading the document and copying the text into a new document. Automatic text extraction is the process of using software to extract the text from the document.

Text extraction can be used for a variety of purposes. One common purpose is to convert documents into a machine-readable format. This can be useful for storing documents in a database or for processing documents with software. Another common purpose is to extract information from documents. This can be useful for finding specific information in a document or for summarizing the content of a document.

Large language models (LLMs) are good for text extraction because they are trained on massive datasets of text and code, which allows them to learn the relationships between words and phrases. They can also understand the context of text and generate text, which allows them to extract information that is not explicitly stated or fill in the gaps in text that is missing information. The answers from LLMs can also be further improved through methods like few-shot prompting.

Learn more about extraction prompts in the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/text/extraction-prompts).

#### Objective <a href="#objective" id="objective"></a>

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use generative models to extract the information from text by working through the following examples:

* Google Pixel technical specifications extraction
* WiFi troubleshooting with constraints
* Respond to inquiries in character
* Converting an ingredients list to JSON format
* Organizing the results of a text extraction

### Text Extraction <a href="#text-extraction" id="text-extraction"></a>

#### Google Pixel technical specifications extraction <a href="#google-pixel-technical-specifications-extraction" id="google-pixel-technical-specifications-extraction"></a>

In this example, you try to extract the technical specifications of a Pixel phone from text in JSON format using the PaLM API.

```python
prompt = """
Extract the technical specifications from the text below in JSON format.

Text: Google Nest WiFi, network speed up to 1200Mpbs, 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequencies, WP3 protocol
JSON: {
  "product":"Google Nest WiFi",
  "speed":"1200Mpbs",
  "frequencies": ["2.4GHz", "5GHz"],
  "protocol":"WP3"
}

Text: Google Pixel 7, 5G network, 8GB RAM, Tensor G2 processor, 128GB of storage, Lemongrass
JSON:
"""

print(
    generation_model.predict(
        prompt, temperature=0.2, max_output_tokens=1024, top_k=40, top_p=0.8
    ).text
)
```

#### WiFi troubleshooting with constraints <a href="#wifi-troubleshooting-with-constraints" id="wifi-troubleshooting-with-constraints"></a>

In this example, you ask the generative model to answer a question about troubleshooting a Google WiFi router based on the description of the different status lights on the router. The model will only be able to respond with the text that was provided, which helps to prevent it from generating potentially harmful or incorrect answers. Here is how you can do this using the PaLM API.

```python
prompt = """
Answer the question using the text below. Respond with only the text provided.
Question: What should I do to fix my disconnected WiFi? The light on my Google WiFi router is yellow and blinking slowly.

Text:
Color: No light
What it means: Router has no power or the light was dimmed in the app.
What to do:
Check that the power cable is properly connected to your router and to a working wall outlet.
If your device is already set up and the light appears off, check your light brightness settings in the app.
If there's still no light, contact WiFi customer support.

Color: Solid white, no light, solid white
What it means: Device is booting up.
What to do:
Wait for the device to boot up. This takes about a minute. When it's done, it will slowly pulse white, letting you know it's ready for setup.

Color: Slow-pulsing white
What it means: Device is ready for set up.
What to do:
Use the Google Home app to set up your router.

Color: Solid white
What it means: Router is online and all is well.
What to do:
You're online. Enjoy!

Color: Slowly pulsing yellow
What it means: There is a network error.
What to do:
Check that the Ethernet cable is connected to both your router and your modem and both devices are turned on. You might need to unplug and plug in each device again.

Color: Fast blinking yellow
What it means: You are holding down the reset button and are factory resetting this device.
What to do:
If you keep holding down the reset button, after about 12 seconds, the light will turn solid yellow. Once it is solid yellow, let go of the factory reset button.

Color: Solid yellow
What it means: Router is factory resetting.
What to do:
This can take up to 10 minutes. When it's done, the device will reset itself and start pulsing white, letting you know it's ready for setup.
Image Solid red light Solid red Something is wrong. Critical failure. Factory reset the router. If the light stays red, contact WiFi customer support.

#### Respond to inquiries in character <a href="#respond-to-inquiries-in-character" id="respond-to-inquiries-in-character"></a>

Now, you instruct the generative model to pretend to be Klara, a person. You will also tell the model about Klara's personality traits. Then, you will ask the model to answer a question as Klara would answer it.

```python
prompt = """
You are Klara.
Klara is an investment manager.
Klara only answers if Klara is sure it is correct.
Klara answers the user question based on the summaries of the pages below.
Klara outputs the Reference ID where Klara found the answer for each sentence in the answer.
Klara also summarizes the part where the information is found.

#### Converting an ingredients list to JSON format <a href="#converting-an-ingredients-list-to-json-format" id="converting-an-ingredients-list-to-json-format"></a>

Suppose that you want to itemize ingredients in recipes to enter into a database, which requires a well-formatted output like JSON. This can be done using a generative model in the following way:

```python
prompt = """
Extract the ingredients from the following recipe. Return the ingredients in JSON format with keys: ingredient, quantity, type.

Ingredients:
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 carrots, chopped
* 2 celery stalks, chopped
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained

#### Organizing the results of a text extraction <a href="#organizing-the-results-of-a-text-extraction" id="organizing-the-results-of-a-text-extraction"></a>

In this section, you extract the information you want from a block of text and organize it in a structured way, such as separating it by commas. Here you use few-shot prompting to guide the model to format your outputs to be separated by commas.

```python
prompt = """
Message: Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), a sheltered but friendly woman, flees her wedding day and wealthy yet unfulfilling life and finds childhood friend Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), a tightly wound but caring chef.
Rachel becomes a waitress at West Village coffee house Central Perk after she moves into Monica\'s apartment above Central Perk and joins Monica\'s group of single friends in their mid-20s:
previous roommate Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), an odd masseuse and musician; neighbor Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), a dim-witted yet loyal struggling actor; Joey\'s roommate Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry),
a sarcastic, self-deprecating data processor; and Monica\'s older brother and Chandler\'s college roommate Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), a sweet-natured but insecure paleontologist.

Extract the characters and the actors who played them from above message:
Rachel Green - Jennifer Aniston, Monica Geller - Courteney Cox, Phoebe Buffay - Lisa Kudrow, Joey Tribbiani - Matt LeBlanc, Chandler Bing - Matthew Perry, Ross Geller - David Schwimmer

Message: Games such as chess, poker, Go, and many video games have always been fertile ground for AI research. Diplomacy is a seven-player game of negotiation and alliance formation, played on an old map of Europe partitioned
into provinces, where each player controls multiple units (rules of Diplomacy). In the standard version of the game, called Press Diplomacy, each turn includes a negotiation phase, after which all players reveal their
chosen moves simultaneously. The heart of Diplomacy is the negotiation phase, where players try to agree on their next moves. For example, one unit may support another unit, allowing it to overcome resistance by other units,
as illustrated here: Computational approaches to Diplomacy have been researched since the 1980s, many of which were explored on a simpler version of the game called No-Press Diplomacy, where strategic communication between
players is not allowed. Researchers have also proposed computer-friendly negotiation protocols, sometimes called \342\200\234Restricted-Press\342\200\235.

Extract the definition of Diplomacy:
A seven-player game of negotiation and alliance formation


Message: Back in 2016, when we weren\'t using simulation and were using a small lab-configuration of industrial robots to learn how to grasp small objects like toys, keys and everyday household items, it took the equivalent of
four months for one robot to learn how to perform a simple grasp with a 75%% success rate. Today, a single robot learns how to perform a complex task such as opening doors with a 90%% success rate with less than a day
of real-world learning. Even more excitingly, we\'ve shown that we can build on the algorithms and learnings from door opening and apply them to a new task: straightening up chairs in our cafes. This progress gives us
hope that our moonshot for building general purpose learning robots might just be possible.

Extract the success rates of the robots in 2016 and today, respectively:
75%, 90%
